# MakersBnB
Makers Academy week 6 challenge
We built a clone of AirBnB in less than a week, using Ruby, Sinatra, PostrgreSQL, DataMapper, which was test-driven with RSpec and Capybara.

See our MakersBnB clone hosted on Heroku on the following link: https://thugmansions.herokuapp.com/

#### Functionality
- Guests / hosts can sign up / log in
- Hosts can list spaces that are available to hire on particular dates
- Guests can search for spaces that are available to hire on particular dates
- Guests can request to book spaces, which the hosts can choose to confirm as booked or reject the booking entirely

#### Instructions for use
- Install PostgreSQL, and then run in the terminal the following:
- $ git clone https://github.com/jackhardy1/MakersBnB
- $ bundle install
- $ rake db:create
- $ rake db:migrate
- $ rackup
